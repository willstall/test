# Unity 5.0 Look
* Real-time mixing
* 64-bit Editor
* Upgraded Physicx Footprint 300% performance upgrade
* WebGL
* Cloud Build
* Launch Video really is awesome
* PHYSICALLY-BASED STANDARD SHADER
* REAL-TIME GLOBAL ILLUMINATION
* HDR Reflections

* 

# Jump in notes
* Serialization Issues in ElementInfo being used in Settings
* Frame Lag Happening every few frames
* Game is Beautiful
* Menus are bland and not what I think we should launch with. I would love to see some type of game or something here.

# Plan 1.0
* Not a lot of concept design has been done. Drawings could go a very long way without much time investment
* 2 Player Controller Mapping ?
( super puzzle fighter deluxe “recommends” controllers )
* Take a serious look at App Flow - The Besiege Menu is BEAUTIFUL. Maybe we should be thinking about something more sexy, like that. There is something really beautiful and fun in the “world” menu/
* Do a more GameJam style Approach
